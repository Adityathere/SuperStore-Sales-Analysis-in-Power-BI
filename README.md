# SuperStore Sales Analysis in Power BI

## Description
The objective of this visualization project is to analyze the sales performance of a fictitious superstore spanning the years 2016 to 2019, leveraging the powerful capabilities of Microsoft Power BI. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sales trends, regional contributions, product performance, and customer behavior within the specified timeframe.

## The three key steps involved in this project include:

Step 1: Data Collection

Step 2: Data Preparation/Cleaning

Step 3: Analysis and Visualization


## Data Collection:
For this Power BI Dashboard project, the dataset was sourced from Kaggle, providing a readily available and convenient starting point. As a beginner, this approach allowed for quick access to a sample dataset without the need for extensive data collection skills. The chosen dataset is the Sample SuperStore dataset, offering a diverse set of sales-related information for analysis.


## Data Preparation/Cleaning
The Data Cleaning involved tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and addressing inconsistencies in columns, ensuring a more accurate and usable dataset for analysis. This phase enabled me to improve the quality of data, and have better insights and decision-making from the Sample SuperStore Dataset.

## Analysis and Visualization
As I mentioned before the goal of this project is to carry out a sales performance analysis for the store. A sales performance analysis should answer the following questions:

1) What are the total sales accrued by the states?

2) What is the revenue accrued annually by the states?

3) What is the average revenue accrued by the states?

4) Which category generates the most revenue for the country?

5) What Region, Category, and Segment yields more revenue at different periods?
